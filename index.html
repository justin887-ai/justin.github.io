        <p>Hi Kaylen,</p>
  
        <p>I know this looks repetitive but yayy it is actually a website now. I wanted to talk to you a bit and I want to sound sincere. I am planning this ahead so I know you just finished a really good interview and everything went smoothly. I hope you can finish this cuz it not that long I promise.</p>
      `,
  
      `
        <p>Before I say anything, and I am adding this just now, I know I did not surprise you in any way lately, and that is cruel of me. I promise none of this is forced. I thought of this completely by myself, and what you said yesterday was completely true. I am just hoping that you see this was not something I did because you said so, but because I wanted to.</p>
  
        <p>I was the worst, and when you were fragile and needed someone to listen, I did not do that. I shrugged off what you said, and thats mean, you should never have to stay with me, and I guarantee I am not asking you to. Everything here is coming from my heart, and for everything I just want to say I am sorry.</p>

        <p>This was going to be that long paragraph that I sent u but mentally I have thought so much more so I just want to say it here, I think ur the bravest and strongest girl ever after everything this year, you went through so much work and got such an amazing set of results most people can only dream of but its not becuase of any talent or how smart u are even though u are quite smart. It's because u are so hardworking. Today everything finally ends and I'm so happy for u, u must feel so relieved.</p> 
      `,
      `
        <p>Before the next page, u have to promise me not to be mad.</p>
      `,
      `
        <p>Do u really promise :3.</p>
      `,
      `
        <p>Okeeee I guess u really promised hehe :)))</p>
      `,
      `
        <p>So I bought a few things again :>> but its not a gift so please don't feel like its forced. I bought the tickets to Spain becuase I want to go with u and we dont have to go as friends and u can go back to Cardiff after if u want its all up to u. I booked tickets and the hotel and we don't have to go as a couple, just a trip u and i as friends and we can go to the beaches and go have good food and I really really promise that I'll keep boundaries because I respect u.</p>
        <p>I know u dont want to do things with me but I promise I'll really just be there to help u whenever u need me to do anything and be ur slave Im there and we can do little shopping and just have fun because u deserve leaving here for a while after all that u did. </p>
      `,
      `
      <p>Hey please tect me back if u want or dont, I respect ur choice entirely and I'm so grateful that u are open to reading this <3, byebye blehhhhh (Pls click next)</p>
