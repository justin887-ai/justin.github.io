        <p>Hi Kaylen,</p>
        <p>I know this looks repetitive but yay its actually a website now, I wanted to talk to u a bit and I want to sound sincere, I'm planning this ahead so I know that u just finished a real good interview and everything went smoothly, I hope u can finish this it wont take u long i promise.</p>
      `,
      `
        <p>Before I say anything and I'm adding this just now, I know I didn't surprise u in anyway lately and that's cruel of me and I promise none of this is forced I thought of this completely by myself and what u said yesterday was completely true I'm just hoping that u see that this was not somehthing I did because u said so but because I wanted to</p>
        <p>I was the worst and when u were fragile and needing someone to listen I didn't do that I did just shrug off what u said and thats mean u should never have to stay with me and I guarantee that I'm not asking u to. I'm trying to sound fancy but u probably can see through me but everything here is coming from my heart and really what I've been feeling, for everything I just want to say I am sorry.</p>
        <p>This was going to be that long paragraph that I sent u but mentally I have thought so much more so I just want to say it here, I think ur the bravest and strongest girl ever after everything this year, you went through so much work and got such an amazing set of results most people can only dream of but its not becuase of any talent or how smart u are even though u are quite smart. It's because u are so hardworking. Today everything finally ends and I'm so happy for u, u must feel so relieved.</p>
      `,
      `
        <p>Before the next page, u have to promise me not to be mad.</p>
      `,
      `
        <p>Do u really promise :3.</p>
      `,
      `
        <p>Okeeee I guess u really promised hehe :)))</p>
